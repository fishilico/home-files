# LUKS-encrypted file helper
#
# Helper script to mount/umount LUKS-encrypted file volume
#
# It is possible to declare in /etc/fstab a LUKS file with the following syntax:
#   #{luksfile}/path/to/file /mnt/mountpoint_name
#
# To perform actions needed root access without entering any password,
# add these lines to /etc/sudoers (using visudo):
#     $USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/losetup --show -f /*
#     $USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/losetup -d /dev/loop*
#     $USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop*
#     $USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/*
#     $USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/umount /dev/mapper/luksfile_*
