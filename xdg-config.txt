Why is there no XDG automatic installation ?
--------------------------------------------

Applications store their settings in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (often $HOME/.config)
directory. This directory contains really many settings. $HOME/.local/share is
another directory often modified by applications. Nevertheless both these
directories depends on installed applications and are populated with default
settings even if the user didn't do anything.

If you wish to copy your confiuguration from a system to another, you may want
to issue the corresponding dconf command (or xfconf-query with XFCE) and put
it in a file. dconf also has an utility to dump and load data. For example
following command dumps your Gedit configuration:
  dconf dump /org/gnome/gedit/

For example to change the default GNOME monospace font (used by gedit), run:
  dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/monospace-font-name "'Droid Sans Mono 10'"
