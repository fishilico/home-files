Accounts Service files
----------------------

Accounts Service provides account-specific data to be used by other systems.
For example when a session manager (GDM, LightDM, ...) uses a profile picture
to identify users, it may use $HOME/.face file, which is a PNG image.

Another location to provide such image is /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/. This
directory may contain user-named files which are PNG profile pictures.

Moreover /var/lib/AccountsService/users/ directory contains user-named files in
.desktop format which specifies some preferences. For example, a French user
named toto using XFCE has file /var/lib/AccountsService/users/toto with:

    [User]
    Language=fr_FR
    XSession=xfce
    Icon=/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/toto
